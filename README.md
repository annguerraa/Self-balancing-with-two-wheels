# Self-balancing-with-two-wheels
Arduino act as PID controller his input is angle value from MPU6050 Sensor and output is the value of PWM that control the speed of motors.

Parts:
motors with wheels
MPU6050 : angle sensor (3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer)
Arduino
L293D : motors driver
motors with wheels
battery
